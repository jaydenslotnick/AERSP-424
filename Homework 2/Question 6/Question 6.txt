what issues you might obtain during the development of
the program? What issues do you think will happen if some of the actions,
e.g., waking up the ATC, checking the traffic pattern, entering the traffic
pattern, diverging to another airport, etc., take time to finish? And what
will be a potential solution for the issues?

One issue is the threads could be attempting to update the shared resource of the number of planes in the traffic pattern at the same time. This is known as the race condition. Therefore, this can cause the overallocation of resources to the traffic pattern as two threads would be attempting to enter the traffic pattern at the same time. One potential fix would be to verify that the traffic pattern is clear by making planes wait to speak to air traffic control. Therefore, multiple threads would not be attempting to update the global variable the planes in the traffic pattern at the same time. In addition, by making planes wait to enter the traffic pattern and update the shared resource, this would also allow all planes to land at the airport rather than be redirected.
