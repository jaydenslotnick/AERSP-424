From Question2, what issues may happen if the robot that finished the
task is assigned a new task immediately? And what will be a potential
solution for the issues?

If a robot is assigned a new task immediately, this could cause a thread hungry issue. If a thread that enters a task function completes its task and is assigned the new task immediately it could become the priority thread where one thread is constantly using needed resources such as the tools in question 2. A thread waiting for the resources to open will never be able to access the tools and therefore, never be able to complete it. To combat this issue, a queue could be implemented. When a robot completes its task a certain number of times, it could be told to enter the back of the queue. Therefore, a robot that is waiting would be able to access the tools and complete their task. In addition, a wait time could be added to a thread after the task execution. This would cause the thread to release the tools it was using and allow for another thread to execute during the wait time.
